I received my Master of Science in Computational Finance & Risk Management and Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from the University of Washington (GPA 3.6/4.0; Dean’s List), where I conducted machine learning research in financial modeling, econometrics, and time-series prediction. 


🔬 Research & Academic Background

My research experience spans:

Machine Learning for Economics & Finance — crypto forecasting with LSTM/RNN, housing price modeling, ensemble learning, and feature engineering

Numerical Optimization & Applied Math — SVD/PCA foundations, Newton/Conjugate-Gradient methods, interpolation, Monte Carlo simulation

Algebraic Structures & Polynomial Theory — factorization, irreducibility proofs, Euclidean rings

I enjoy connecting rigorous mathematics with modern AI/ML systems.

🛠️ Engineering & Industry Experience

I currently lead the development of a full-stack AI Agent & LLMOps platform, integrating:

Python (Flask, SQLAlchemy), Postgres

React/Tailwind

LangChain / LangGraph

Vector DBs: Faiss, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus

CI/CD, Celery async queues, JWT/OAuth authentication, workflow versioning

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), hybrid retrieval, multi-query fusion

I previously worked as a Data Analyst at Skyline and Data Analyst / Modeling Intern at Google, focusing on:

AML/KYC model development & governance

Compliance rule modeling and automations

User behavior analytics (AARRR, RMF)

Time-series and forecasting analysis

Data pipelines, reporting, visualization (PowerBI, SQL, Python)

🚀 Current Interests

LLM Agents: ReAct, LCEL, memory-augmented agent systems

RAG Systems: hybrid retrieval, re-ranking, long-context processing

LLMOps: monitoring, lifecycle, orchestration, workflow graphs

AI + Optimization: numerical methods, search, efficient inference

Computer Vision: multimodal RAG, generative models, VLMs

🎯 Now

I am preparing for a PhD in Hong Kong (2026 intake) focusing on computer vision, multimodal AI, and agent systems.

Feel free to explore my projects or connect with me!
